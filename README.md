### Features
This tool can be used to encode 16-bits PCM Wav files to the PS2 Vag Format, and vice-versa. 

It is only compatible with headerless PS2 Vag files, so, to decode a Vag file is required to know previously the frequency and the number of channels to avoid undesired results when decoding.
